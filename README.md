hoverfix
========

Hoverfix is an accessible way to provide extra information about a link. Instead of the title attribute, it uses the CSS span tag behind the scenes, but acts like a tooltip or mousehover. When the element comes into focus, the information is displayed. Text in the span tag is read by screen readers and easily accessed by tabbing (for those who can't use a mouse).
